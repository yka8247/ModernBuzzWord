  # ModernBuzzWord
  Scrum Project for SWEN-356. Its a simple web application that aggregates a collection
  of random buzzwords and allows a user to create startup company name ideas from them.

  You'll need BOWER, GULP, and NPM installed. You need to run `bower install`,
  `npm install`, and then `gulp` all from the root of the project. Then run `npm start` and
  navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app. Live reloads aren't quite working yet, so
  code changes can be seen after re-running `npm start`.
